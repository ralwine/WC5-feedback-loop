For this project, I constructed a basic feedback survey loop somewhat based on the reflections feature in our student portal. I started by making an outline of how I wanted the project to look and partly map out process as well. 

My first task in terms of writing code was to establish the routes that would allow movement between consecutive screens on a button click and the much of the static HTML/CSS for each of my screens.
